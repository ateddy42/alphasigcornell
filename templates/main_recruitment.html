          <p>Like many people in Greek life, I initially had no intentions of joining a fraternity. I ended up deciding to give it a shot and after meeting some of the guys at rush events I immediately knew that these were the men I wanted to call my brothers. Joining Alpha Sigma Phi has provided me the endless social experiences of college as well as the tools to grow and improve as an individual. Whether it’s holding events at our chapter house or catching the big game in the lounge, there’s never a dull moment when I’m with my brothers. Besides allowing me to live in the Rockledge Manor, a mansion, with my best friends, the fraternity has helped me develop as a student and a leader while giving me varied experiences and alumni connections that will excel me forward throughout my career. I couldn’t imagine my time at Cornell without Alpha Sig.</p><p class="message-sig">Armaan Jhunjhnuwala ‘18<br/>Mechanical Engineering</p>
